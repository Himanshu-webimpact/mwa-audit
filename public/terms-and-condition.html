              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
              ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
              and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set
              either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
              subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
